# Next task handover

Status: released milestone with the next recommendation recorded below

Prepared: 29 July 2026

Milestone ID: `CUSTOMER-ADVISOR-CONTEXT-02`

Implementation baseline: `0a82a992e162087eb5ac76b4227dee3a505eae5b`

Deployed application before this milestone: Sites version 205 from `0a82a992e162087eb5ac76b4227dee3a505eae5b`

Released application: `7e772ace2dc8fa26a05863e1fa865d58e4fdbd77`, first deployed as Sites version 206

Production URL: `https://compare.ausenergyassessments.com`

The [complete current-state audit](./audit/2026-07-21-complete-current-state/README.md) remains the immutable evidence baseline. [RELEASE_TRUTH.md](./RELEASE_TRUTH.md) owns current implementation status and application deployment identity. [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) owns approved forward sequencing. A later documentation-only Sites checkpoint does not become a new executable application release: application identity remains commit `7e772ace2dc8fa26a05863e1fa865d58e4fdbd77`, Sites version 206 and deployment `appgdep_6a68ff2f45d08191aec1274c14168407`; the Sites saved-version record owns the exact publication identity of any documentation-only child.

## Milestone outcome

The administrator notification inbox now keeps an expanded case open and at its prior visible position when the automatic audited read-state update refreshes and reorders the queue.

The household project builder also completes the next four advisor priorities:

1. controlled evidence-source confidence and provenance;
2. postcode and state based broad climate sequencing;
3. room-by-room comfort evidence that changes advice only when the concern and use period belong to the same room; and
4. a renter, owner and strata permission checklist derived from tenure, approval context, the current plan and remaining evidence questions.

The result remains an independent, brand-agnostic planning workflow. It is not a NatHERS assessment, legal permission decision, quote, fixed-price estimate or savings promise.

## User outcomes

- An administrator can open an unread case without the case collapsing or jumping away when the read update completes.
- Explicit close and resolve remain deliberate actions.
- A deliberate queue, search, category, priority, status or assignee change resets the open-case boundary instead of keeping an out-of-filter record visible.
- A household can label each important controlled fact as not known, customer reported, photo available for review or document available for review.
- Evidence labels describe the available source only. They do not claim that a file is attached to the fact, professionally reviewed or verified.
- A valid matching postcode and state produce a broad planning profile that can change whether shading or building-shell investigation appears first.
- Invalid, non-residential or postcode/state-mismatched input produces no climate profile.
- A household can add up to twelve private room profiles using controlled room types, concerns and use periods.
- Same-room hot daytime evidence can lead with shade and solar control. Same-room cold overnight evidence can lead with safe draught and insulation investigation.
- Private room names and routines do not enter the installer opportunity.
- Renter-portable and reversible actions appear before permission-dependent fixed work.
- The customer can build and preview a five-section property-permission checklist before downloading it.
- A customer-selected permission class cannot remove a mandatory licensed trade or site check.
- Arbitrary permission titles, identifiers and note wording remain inside the signed-in project. The shareable checklist uses controlled text and private-note reminders.
- Every generated evidence, climate and room step links to a plain-language explanation.

## In scope

- Stabilise the expanded case in `AdminNotificationInbox` across audited background refreshes.
- Add a small pure state helper for queue pinning and explicit reset semantics.
- Add regression tests for reordering, filter-boundary updates, unavailable cases and deliberate filter changes.
- Add `customer_projects.advisor_profile` as additive JSON text through `0082_customer_advisor_profile.sql`.
- Persist and hydrate the advisor profile through create, update, list and duplicate project paths.
- Add server normalization for evidence sources, climate, rooms and permission items.
- Keep a maximum of twelve rooms, sixty characters per private room name and controlled values for room type, concern and use period.
- Keep a maximum of thirty permission items and controlled classifications.
- Generate the permission pack from tenure, strata context, current plan, evidence gaps and customer classifications.
- Keep authoritative safety rules in their controlled section even when customer classification differs.
- Replace arbitrary shareable permission text with controlled reminders.
- Derive installer opportunity context from broad climate, controlled room-type and concern aggregates, and known or unknown source counts.
- Preserve the exact-postcode allocation boundary while returning an empty postcode to installers before contact release.
- Add preparation-guide sections for evidence, broad climate and room comfort.
- Correct guide paragraph contrast on the navy customer canvas.

## Out of scope

- Professional review or verification of household evidence.
- Formal NatHERS climate zones, ratings, certificates or equipment sizing.
- Legal advice or proof that owner, agent, strata or owners-corporation permission has been granted.
- Brand, product, provider or installer ranking.
- Current market-price estimates or guaranteed savings.
- Automatic access for an assessor.
- Creation of real customer, trade, wholesaler or assessor accounts.
- Generic Database Console withdrawal.
- Changes to the immutable dated audit.
- Netlify deployment.

## Advisor and privacy boundaries

- Use `independent home energy plan`, not `NatHERS assessment` or `NatHERS certificate`.
- Treat `Not sure` as valid information.
- Do not infer attachment review, professional validation or proof from a customer source selection.
- Do not tell customers to enter roof spaces, climb roofs, remove electrical covers or block required ventilation.
- Keep room names, room use periods, permission titles, permission notes, exact location and project-private notes out of installer opportunity payloads.
- Keep arbitrary permission wording out of the shareable checklist.
- Use controlled aggregates only where installer matching needs them.
- Keep the permission checklist as a question and review aid. It does not grant permission or replace licensed or site-specific advice.
- Use broad climate only to order investigations. It does not size equipment or predict savings.

## Data and compatibility requirements

- `customer_projects.advisor_profile` is additive JSON text with default `{}`.
- The forward migration is `0082_customer_advisor_profile.sql`. Applied migration history remains unchanged.
- The current plan version is `2026-07-29-evidence-climate-advisor`.
- The prior `2026-07-29-home-advisor` plan version is legacy and regenerates through the existing edited-plan conflict boundary.
- Server normalization derives climate from the stored postcode and state. Client-supplied climate text is not authoritative.
- Invalid evidence-source, room, concern, use-period and permission values fall back to controlled safe states.
- Room concerns affect plan sequencing only when the relevant concern and use period occur in the same room.
- User classification is supplementary. It cannot replace an authoritative permission or licensed-site-check rule.
- API writes remain owner scoped and preserve backward compatibility for rows without an advisor profile.
- Duplicate projects preserve the normalized advisor profile without creating installer disclosure.

## Acceptance criteria

- The first unread demo case remains expanded and first in the visible queue after its automatic audited read update.
- That case no longer shows its `Mark read` action after the update, while `Close case` remains available.
- Manual filter changes reset the pinned case.
- Evidence labels make no unsupported review or attachment claim.
- Valid postcode and state input produce one bounded planning profile; invalid or mismatched input produces none.
- Hot daytime and cold overnight rules do not cross-correlate separate rooms.
- Room and permission limits are enforced by server normalization.
- Renter-portable actions precede fixed or permission-dependent work.
- The permission pack contains five controlled sections and retains authoritative safety rules.
- Malicious or private permission titles, notes and identifiers are not copied into the pack.
- Installer opportunity output excludes private room and permission content.
- Focused tests, full validation, all migrations, the production build, diff hygiene, source provenance and live checks pass.

## Validation commands and observed results

The exact application commit passed:

```powershell
node --experimental-strip-types --test test/admin-notification-inbox-stability.test.mjs test/customer-advisor-contract.test.mjs test/customer-project-advisor-ui.test.mjs test/customer-project-advisor.test.mjs
npm.cmd run validate
node --experimental-strip-types --test
git diff --check
```

Observed results:

- focused advisor and administrator regression set: 38 of 38 passed;
- integration suite inside the release gate: 32 of 32 passed;
- full suite: 770 tests, 768 passed, 2 intentionally skipped and 0 failed;
- type checking: passed;
- warning-free lint: passed;
- migration verification: all 83 migrations passed on fresh SQLite and Cloudflare D1 paths;
- Vinext production build: passed;
- `git diff --check`: passed;
- application source and Sites managed branch: exact SHA `7e772ace2dc8fa26a05863e1fa865d58e4fdbd77`;
- Sites application version: 206, deployment `appgdep_6a68ff2f45d08191aec1274c14168407`, public, environment revision 19;
- public health, guide, signed-out customer route and administrator shell: HTTP 200;
- signed-in customer verification: all five steps selectable; evidence labels, room profile, broad climate, editable plan and five-section permission preview present;
- responsive verification: desktop guide contrast is readable; the 390 by 844 computed layout has no horizontal overflow;
- signed-in administrator verification: one working-demo notification changed from unread to read, stayed expanded and retained its first visible position;
- no real account was created or used.

The Sites error-only query returned three informational canceled `/api/electricity-plans` health-monitor invocations and no exception message attributable to the newly checked release routes. The monitor cancellation remains a separate operational observation, not a passing end-to-end electricity-plan provider check.

## Release and stop conditions

Stop the affected work when:

- evidence wording would imply professional review that did not occur;
- broad climate wording could be mistaken for a NatHERS result;
- room or permission text could disclose private household information to installers;
- a customer classification could remove a mandatory safety or licensed-site check;
- advice could encourage unsafe inspection, blocked ventilation or unauthorised fixed work;
- a change would create or use a real account for release testing;
- the release commit, GitHub branch, Sites source, archive and saved version do not reconcile;
- a change would alter the immutable dated audit;
- a legal, regulated-service, privacy, provider or account-ownership decision requires an authorised human.

## Next five logical product steps

1. **Household and assessor usability pilot:** run representative owner, renter and experienced-assessor journeys, then repair priority accessibility and comprehension friction.
2. **Recommendation rationale and uncertainty:** show why each item appears, which controlled inputs support it, what remains unknown and what could change its order.
3. **Adaptive next-best-question guidance:** ask at most three material unanswered questions at a time, retain `Not sure`, and avoid unsafe inspection.
4. **Customer-owned assessor review and clarification:** keep customer reports separate from authored assessor observations and customer-approved proposed changes.
5. **Decision-ready independent plan brief:** provide an accessible, brand-agnostic printable or downloadable brief with private location and notes excluded by default.
