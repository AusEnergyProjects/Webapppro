# Next task handover

Status: released implementation milestone

Prepared: 30 July 2026

Milestone ID: `CUSTOMER-PROJECT-CLEANUP-12`

Implementation baseline: `23594c2b61dec855aeba0a10ba5a28eb3aeaf692`

Released application for this milestone: Sites version 227 from application commit `da35ce60295d6c7150cddd9b35e33fcf64c8521b`

Current source checkpoint: the documentation-only child containing this record; it does not change the executable application identity above

Production URL: `https://compare.ausenergyassessments.com`

The [complete current-state audit](./audit/2026-07-21-complete-current-state/README.md) remains the immutable evidence baseline. [RELEASE_TRUTH.md](./RELEASE_TRUTH.md) owns released implementation status and application deployment identity. [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) owns approved forward sequencing. The household and experienced-assessor pilot remains deliberately deferred while the five next product steps recorded below are completed.

## Current milestone outcome

Make saved-project controls clean and compact, and let customers permanently remove an unused private draft through a deliberate, accessible and server-protected action.

The release adds a quiet `Delete draft` action beside `Continue project`, an accessible confirmation dialog, and an authenticated owner-scoped deletion contract that refuses submitted or linked projects. It also repairs the oversized project-detail control column and keeps the primary dashboard labels readable. Existing plan, report, evidence, privacy and trade-handover contracts remain unchanged.

## Current user outcomes

- Draft project cards show compact `Delete draft` and `Continue project` controls in one aligned desktop row.
- Narrow screens receive two equal-width touch controls instead of a cramped or uneven footer.
- Active and completed workflows never expose permanent deletion.
- The confirmation explains that deletion is permanent, focuses `Keep draft` first, traps keyboard focus and returns focus when cancelled.
- Deletion cannot be triggered through the existing PATCH action surface or by supplying an object key from the browser.
- A stale draft or a project linked to enquiry, quote, contact, appointment, arrival or handover activity is retained.
- Project-detail controls remain at the top of their card and no longer stretch through the full roadmap height.

## Current in scope

- Compact dashboard project actions and project-detail control sizing.
- Draft-only delete visibility and customer-facing confirmation.
- Same-origin Firebase authentication, active-account and owner checks.
- Exact plan-revision and update-time conflict protection.
- Linked-lifecycle refusal before and after the internal deletion lock.
- Server-selected R2 object cleanup and owner-scoped dependent-record cleanup.
- Retry-safe internal `deleting` state that remains presented as a private draft.
- Focused UI, accessibility, source-contract and server-boundary regressions.

## Current out of scope

- The deferred household and experienced-assessor field pilot.
- Permanent deletion of submitted, matching, withdrawn, completed or linked projects.
- A bulk delete, administrator delete or restoration service after confirmed permanent deletion.
- Changes to plan content, reporting, evidence sharing, trade matching or account creation.
- A destructive live test against any working-demo project.
- The existing five forward product steps recorded below.
- Changes to the immutable dated audit or a Netlify deployment.

## Current privacy and safety boundaries

- The server derives the customer identity from the verified Firebase token and scopes every lookup and delete to that owner.
- The browser supplies only the project ID, explicit confirmation, plan revision and last-updated token.
- Evidence object keys are selected inside the server and never accepted from or returned to the customer delete request.
- Any submission, opportunity, quote, contact release, appointment notification, arrival or handover evidence blocks permanent deletion.
- An internal lock prevents concurrent edits and a second lifecycle check catches links created during the deletion boundary.
- R2 failure restores the retryable draft. D1 failure never reports success and retains a retryable private state.
- Existing household-answer, evidence-sharing, adviser, report and product-neutral guidance boundaries are unchanged.

## Current acceptance criteria

- Draft cards expose compact aligned delete and continue actions; non-draft cards do not expose deletion.
- Mobile controls remain equal-width, readable and at least 44 px high.
- The confirmation is a labelled modal with safe initial focus, Tab containment, Escape cancellation, background scroll lock and busy-state dismissal protection.
- The delete endpoint is same-origin, authenticated, active-account, owner, confirmation and stale-write protected.
- Linked customer or trade lifecycle records prevent deletion.
- Dependent private evidence, plan-revision, outcome and project-specific consent rows are owner scoped and the project record is deleted last.
- Type checking, warning-free lint, 31 integration tests, the complete 863-test suite, all 85 migrations, the Vinext production build, diff hygiene, GitHub provenance and Sites provenance pass.
- Live signed-in inspection confirms the dashboard, dialog and project-detail layouts without confirming a deletion.
- Live `/api/health` returns HTTP `200`.

## Current stop conditions

Stop the affected path when:

- permanent deletion could appear for a non-draft project;
- a delete could be triggered through PATCH or without explicit confirmation;
- the server could accept a client-selected object key or act outside the authenticated owner;
- a stale project could be deleted after newer edits;
- any linked enquiry, quote, contact, appointment, arrival or handover record could be removed;
- storage or database failure could be reported as success;
- a live verification step would confirm deletion of a working-demo project;
- the release commit, GitHub branch, Sites source, archive, saved version and deployment do not reconcile;
- the immutable audit would change; or
- a legal, privacy, regulated-service or account-ownership decision requires an authorised human.

## Known release risk

`npm audit --omit=dev` reports six existing production-dependency advisories: one low and five high. The current direct dependencies include Next 16.2.10 and `react-server-dom-webpack` 19.2.6; the audit proposes updates to Next 16.2.12 and `react-server-dom-webpack` 19.2.8. This was not introduced by the PDF feature and must be handled as a separate bounded dependency patch with the complete validation and live-release gates.

## Prior released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-TRUST-11`

The prior release established the shared premium preview, duplicated bottom actions, guided private photos, bounded revision compare and restore, tagged-PDF foundations through format `2026-07-30-tagged-plan-pdf-v3` and adaptive email compatibility. Its exact application commit was `bc427d295b3106907904a3c0b7bf9f2945561cd1`, deployed as Sites version 224 through deployment `appgdep_6a6b151c0178819185e4d57c1cbf75c2`. Documentation-only child `23594c2b61dec855aeba0a10ba5a28eb3aeaf692` was later published as historical Sites version 225 without changing that executable application. Those contracts remain active underneath version 227.

## Earlier released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-SPACING-10`

The earlier release established consistent spacing and rounded surfaces throughout the premium PDF and email. Its exact application commit was `e74c2d95889a381cb3bb434607bc6584e54cf722`, deployed as Sites version 222 through deployment `appgdep_6a6a8887a0048191b7eb1706e742ad28`. Documentation-only child `c2599eb5bedb11b1648da2b4a60e11b242cb2abb` was later published as historical Sites version 223 without changing that executable application. Those visual contracts remain active underneath version 227.

## Earlier released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-TECH-PRESENTATION-09`

The earlier release established the exact-brand technical presentation, truthful completed-plan signals and single household or professional evidence boundary. Its exact application commit was `f401575a5bf463b85c7688424db0b99dddd220c5`, first deployed as Sites version 220 through deployment `appgdep_6a6a265a51108191bdc8ae6a4eefbf8f`. Those contracts remain active underneath the later spacing and trust releases.

## Earlier released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-PREMIUM-REPORT-08`

The earlier release established the shared premium PDF, responsive email HTML and plain-text hierarchy while retaining the reliable non-mutating native attachment path. Its exact application commit was `fb6cacf8b0309a3fc26b40a43da5b025050d22d2`, first deployed as Sites version 218 through deployment `appgdep_6a6a11c02e088191bb27cc302c8b35af`. Documentation-only child `a92e18b9ea79b53eaf6eda8665f37ec02c861972` was recorded as historical Sites version 219 without changing that executable application. The shared report projection and privacy boundaries remain active underneath the later technical presentation and spacing releases.

## Earlier released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-NATIVE-PDF-07`

The prior release established the reliable non-mutating browser-native PDF attachment path. Its exact application commit was `8cdec99bcd2d1cb9f2ec0dc18c87a71860412642`, first deployed as Sites version 216 through deployment `appgdep_6a69f763e0b08191b6ac8539e0828d84`. Its delivery mechanism remains active underneath the premium report presentation.

## Earlier released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-DIRECT-PDF-06`

The prior direct-PDF release used a client worker and produced a valid PDF from the public planner. Its exact application commit was `d5c675a5ceffa6e924df033e8cb8b505bb4d6336`, first deployed as Sites version 214 through deployment `appgdep_6a69e79a91548191987f12631559cb1f`. The signed-in action was not exercised during that release and later failed the product-owner operational check: it saved the project and could process or upload pending evidence before generating the PDF, then relied on a delayed hidden-link click. It is superseded by `CUSTOMER-PLAN-NATIVE-PDF-07`.

## Earlier released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-PRO-PRINT-05`

The prior release added the optional self-declared professional review and bounded everyday-action section. Its exact application commit was `ee75aadfd6800c01b92532b2d376a4a1e33c9d74`, first deployed as Sites version 212 through deployment `appgdep_6a69c4f838bc8191a0e050da219ab4a6`. Its temporary-frame browser-print mitigation passed source-level gates but was superseded after the product owner reproduced a Chrome freeze.

## Earlier released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-EVIDENCE-04`

The prior release established the shared categorized fourteen-question home-detail taxonomy, explicit `Not sure` handling, private-by-default evidence scope, bounded plan history and one concise privacy-filtered report across email and print. Its exact application commit was `6540ee671e64dbfdf80592283a1954b2ff482355`, first deployed as Sites version 210 through deployment `appgdep_6a695ca742d081918d73196751713f98`.

## Earlier released milestone: `CUSTOMER-PLAN-DECISION-03`

### Milestone outcome

Turn the current household plan into a decision-ready, independently useful document without implying a site assessment, authenticated assessor review or savings guarantee.

The milestone completes the four post-context product priorities:

1. explain why each controlled plan item appears, what remains unknown and what could change its position;
2. show no more than three safe, material next questions, with `Not sure` always valid;
3. add a private customer-owned review worksheet that clearly labels feedback as `Recorded by you`; and
4. produce one privacy-filtered independent plan brief for accessible preview, email and A4 print or browser PDF.

It also removes the visible product drift reported in the same customer journey:

- reinforce readable project-preparation guide paragraphs on the navy canvas;
- make the draft save-status message readable and announce changes accessibly;
- replace the stale public `/plan` recommendation contract with the current canonical advisor options and generator; and
- provide an accessible email-recipient dialog plus `Print or save PDF` action from the signed-in plan step.

### User outcomes

- A household can understand the controlled evidence behind each recommendation without being shown a false numerical confidence score.
- At most three unanswered questions identify the next information that could materially change safety, permission or plan order.
- A customer can privately record questions, feedback they heard and proposed changes without the system claiming that an assessor authored or verified them.
- Accepting a recorded proposal does not silently change the plan. A customer must explicitly add it as a private plan step.
- A verified signed-in customer can save the exact current draft, enter one confirmed recipient and request one independently useful plan email.
- The email response says `Accepted for delivery`; it does not claim inbox delivery.
- The same privacy-filtered document appears in a high-contrast A4 print view that supports printing or the browser's Save as PDF action.
- The public quick planner uses the same canonical goals, tenure, approval, budget, home-feature and recommendation boundaries as the signed-in advisor.
- Private project labels, exact location, room routines, filenames, account contact data, private notes, customer review text and arbitrary permission text do not enter the independent brief.

### In scope

- Bump the versioned customer plan contract while preserving edited legacy plans through the existing conflict boundary.
- Add bounded, controlled rationale and next-question derivation.
- Extend the existing owner-scoped advisor-profile JSON with at most twenty private review items.
- Keep review kinds, targets and statuses allowlisted and text capped at 500 characters.
- Add a shared privacy-filtered plan-document projection with escaped inline HTML and plain text.
- Add authenticated, owner-scoped email delivery with explicit recipient confirmation, strict single-address validation, idempotency and a fail-closed five-attempt hourly rate limit.
- Reuse the configured email delivery provider. Do not add a new provider or send a release-test email to a real address.
- Add an accessible modal with focus management, Escape close, focus return and live status.
- Add an A4 print surface generated from the same saved plan projection.
- Reconcile the public quick planner and account handoff with the current canonical plan engine.
- Add focused domain, privacy, route, provider, accessibility, responsive and contrast regression tests.

### Out of scope

- The deferred household or experienced-assessor field pilot.
- Remote assessor invitations, authenticated assessor identity, external editing, access tokens or reviewer credentials.
- Professional evidence review, verification or a claim that an attachment has been assessed.
- A formal NatHERS assessment, NatHERS certificate, energy rating, equipment sizing or legal approval.
- Brands, provider ranking, current market prices, savings promises or finance advice.
- A server-side browser or a binary PDF generation dependency. A4 print plus browser Save as PDF is the bounded PDF path.
- Real customer, trade, wholesaler or assessor account creation.
- Installer opportunity, direct-contact, payment or subscription changes.
- Changes to the immutable dated audit.
- Netlify deployment.

### Privacy and safety boundaries

- Guidance and next questions are derived only from controlled inputs and fixed internal guide destinations.
- `Not sure` is useful evidence and never blocks saving or submission.
- Questions must not ask a person to climb a roof, enter a roof space, remove electrical covers, block required ventilation or perform unsafe inspection.
- Review text remains customer-owned private project data. It never enters installer opportunity output, permission packs, email, print or public planner URLs.
- Only the owning active customer can read or write the saved plan used for delivery.
- Email delivery accepts one normalized address, requires a verified account and explicit confirmation, and fails closed when rate-limit storage or provider configuration is unavailable.
- Custom plan text and private plan notes are omitted from the independent brief. The brief reports omitted counts without copying the wording.
- The report is an independent home energy plan prepared from customer selections. It is not a completed site assessment, quote, legal permission decision or savings promise.

### Acceptance criteria

- Every canonical generated plan item has bounded `Based on`, `Still uncertain` and `Could change if` guidance.
- Next questions are deterministic, unique, fixed-destination, safe and capped at three.
- Review-item normalization enforces kinds, targets, statuses, length and count; invalid targets do not create an assessor identity or verification state.
- Submitted-project locking and duplicate-before-revision behaviour remain intact.
- Review text cannot enter installer opportunity, permission-pack or independent-brief output.
- The plan email API rejects missing consent, unverified identity, inactive account, wrong ownership, archived projects, multiple or malformed recipients, oversized bodies, unavailable rate limiting and unavailable provider configuration.
- No automated test or live release check sends an email to a real address.
- The print surface uses the exact saved ordering and controlled current plan content, is keyboard reachable and renders on A4 without the application shell.
- The public `/plan` and signed-in advisor produce the same canonical item sequence for equivalent controlled input.
- Project-preparation paragraphs and the draft status meet readable contrast and mobile layout requirements.
- Focused tests, the full validation gate, all migrations, production build, diff hygiene, source provenance and desktop plus 390 px live checks pass.

### Stop conditions

Stop the affected path when:

- actual remote assessor access or identity is required;
- arbitrary review, project or permission text could escape into installer or shared output;
- an accepted review changes the plan without a second explicit customer action;
- an unsafe question or blocking guess would be introduced;
- legacy edited plan items would be lost during version regeneration;
- provider configuration, rate-limit storage or source provenance cannot be verified;
- a change would create or use a real account for release testing;
- the release commit, GitHub branch, Sites source, archive and saved version do not reconcile;
- a change would alter the immutable dated audit; or
- a legal, privacy, regulated-service or account-ownership decision requires an authorised human.

- Sites application version: 208, deployment `appgdep_6a6943bcb758819196c764370a2b683a`, public, environment revision 19;
- required Sites delivery and limiter configuration names are present; secret values were not read or reproduced;
- live public `/plan` exposes the reconciled seven-part advisor intake and controlled question-led result;
- the live guide paragraph colour is `rgb(185, 204, 215)` on the navy canvas with no horizontal overflow;
- the live print route contains the ordered plan, decision questions, guide links and browser Print or Save as PDF action;
- representative local A4 output was inspected across four pages with complete cards, visible links, clean page breaks and no application shell;
- no real account was created or used, no working-demo data changed and no release check sent an email.

The authenticated email route and signed-in sharing UI were verified through owner-scope, privacy, provider, idempotency, limiter, modal and projection regressions. Live delivery was deliberately not exercised because the release boundary prohibits sending a test message to a real address.

## Prior released milestone: `CUSTOMER-ADVISOR-CONTEXT-02`

### Milestone outcome

The administrator notification inbox now keeps an expanded case open and at its prior visible position when the automatic audited read-state update refreshes and reorders the queue.

The household project builder also completes the next four advisor priorities:

1. controlled evidence-source confidence and provenance;
2. postcode and state based broad climate sequencing;
3. room-by-room comfort evidence that changes advice only when the concern and use period belong to the same room; and
4. a renter, owner and strata permission checklist derived from tenure, approval context, the current plan and remaining evidence questions.

The result remains an independent, brand-agnostic planning workflow. It is not a NatHERS assessment, legal permission decision, quote, fixed-price estimate or savings promise.

### User outcomes

- An administrator can open an unread case without the case collapsing or jumping away when the read update completes.
- Explicit close and resolve remain deliberate actions.
- A deliberate queue, search, category, priority, status or assignee change resets the open-case boundary instead of keeping an out-of-filter record visible.
- A household can label each important controlled fact as not known, customer reported, photo available for review or document available for review.
- Evidence labels describe the available source only. They do not claim that a file is attached to the fact, professionally reviewed or verified.
- A valid matching postcode and state produce a broad planning profile that can change whether shading or building-shell investigation appears first.
- Invalid, non-residential or postcode/state-mismatched input produces no climate profile.
- A household can add up to twelve private room profiles using controlled room types, concerns and use periods.
- Same-room hot daytime evidence can lead with shade and solar control. Same-room cold overnight evidence can lead with safe draught and insulation investigation.
- Private room names and routines do not enter the installer opportunity.
- Renter-portable and reversible actions appear before permission-dependent fixed work.
- The customer can build and preview a five-section property-permission checklist before downloading it.
- A customer-selected permission class cannot remove a mandatory licensed trade or site check.
- Arbitrary permission titles, identifiers and note wording remain inside the signed-in project. The shareable checklist uses controlled text and private-note reminders.
- Every generated evidence, climate and room step links to a plain-language explanation.

### In scope

- Stabilise the expanded case in `AdminNotificationInbox` across audited background refreshes.
- Add a small pure state helper for queue pinning and explicit reset semantics.
- Add regression tests for reordering, filter-boundary updates, unavailable cases and deliberate filter changes.
- Add `customer_projects.advisor_profile` as additive JSON text through `0082_customer_advisor_profile.sql`.
- Persist and hydrate the advisor profile through create, update, list and duplicate project paths.
- Add server normalization for evidence sources, climate, rooms and permission items.
- Keep a maximum of twelve rooms, sixty characters per private room name and controlled values for room type, concern and use period.
- Keep a maximum of thirty permission items and controlled classifications.
- Generate the permission pack from tenure, strata context, current plan, evidence gaps and customer classifications.
- Keep authoritative safety rules in their controlled section even when customer classification differs.
- Replace arbitrary shareable permission text with controlled reminders.
- Derive installer opportunity context from broad climate, controlled room-type and concern aggregates, and known or unknown source counts.
- Preserve the exact-postcode allocation boundary while returning an empty postcode to installers before contact release.
- Add preparation-guide sections for evidence, broad climate and room comfort.
- Correct guide paragraph contrast on the navy customer canvas.

### Out of scope

- Professional review or verification of household evidence.
- Formal NatHERS climate zones, ratings, certificates or equipment sizing.
- Legal advice or proof that owner, agent, strata or owners-corporation permission has been granted.
- Brand, product, provider or installer ranking.
- Current market-price estimates or guaranteed savings.
- Automatic access for an assessor.
- Creation of real customer, trade, wholesaler or assessor accounts.
- Generic Database Console withdrawal.
- Changes to the immutable dated audit.
- Netlify deployment.

### Advisor and privacy boundaries

- Use `independent home energy plan`, not `NatHERS assessment` or `NatHERS certificate`.
- Treat `Not sure` as valid information.
- Do not infer attachment review, professional validation or proof from a customer source selection.
- Do not tell customers to enter roof spaces, climb roofs, remove electrical covers or block required ventilation.
- Keep room names, room use periods, permission titles, permission notes, exact location and project-private notes out of installer opportunity payloads.
- Keep arbitrary permission wording out of the shareable checklist.
- Use controlled aggregates only where installer matching needs them.
- Keep the permission checklist as a question and review aid. It does not grant permission or replace licensed or site-specific advice.
- Use broad climate only to order investigations. It does not size equipment or predict savings.

### Data and compatibility requirements

- `customer_projects.advisor_profile` is additive JSON text with default `{}`.
- The forward migration is `0082_customer_advisor_profile.sql`. Applied migration history remains unchanged.
- That prior release's plan version was `2026-07-29-evidence-climate-advisor`.
- The prior `2026-07-29-home-advisor` plan version is legacy and regenerates through the existing edited-plan conflict boundary.
- Server normalization derives climate from the stored postcode and state. Client-supplied climate text is not authoritative.
- Invalid evidence-source, room, concern, use-period and permission values fall back to controlled safe states.
- Room concerns affect plan sequencing only when the relevant concern and use period occur in the same room.
- User classification is supplementary. It cannot replace an authoritative permission or licensed-site-check rule.
- API writes remain owner scoped and preserve backward compatibility for rows without an advisor profile.
- Duplicate projects preserve the normalized advisor profile without creating installer disclosure.

### Acceptance criteria

- The first unread demo case remains expanded and first in the visible queue after its automatic audited read update.
- That case no longer shows its `Mark read` action after the update, while `Close case` remains available.
- Manual filter changes reset the pinned case.
- Evidence labels make no unsupported review or attachment claim.
- Valid postcode and state input produce one bounded planning profile; invalid or mismatched input produces none.
- Hot daytime and cold overnight rules do not cross-correlate separate rooms.
- Room and permission limits are enforced by server normalization.
- Renter-portable actions precede fixed or permission-dependent work.
- The permission pack contains five controlled sections and retains authoritative safety rules.
- Malicious or private permission titles, notes and identifiers are not copied into the pack.
- Installer opportunity output excludes private room and permission content.
- Focused tests, full validation, all migrations, the production build, diff hygiene, source provenance and live checks pass.

- signed-in customer verification: all five steps selectable; evidence labels, room profile, broad climate, editable plan and five-section permission preview present;
- responsive verification: desktop guide contrast is readable; the 390 by 844 computed layout has no horizontal overflow;
- signed-in administrator verification: one working-demo notification changed from unread to read, stayed expanded and retained its first visible position;
- no real account was created or used.

The Sites error-only query returned three informational canceled `/api/electricity-plans` health-monitor invocations and no exception message attributable to the newly checked release routes. The monitor cancellation remains a separate operational observation, not a passing end-to-end electricity-plan provider check.

### Release and stop conditions

Stop the affected work when:

- evidence wording would imply professional review that did not occur;
- broad climate wording could be mistaken for a NatHERS result;
- room or permission text could disclose private household information to installers;
- a customer classification could remove a mandatory safety or licensed-site check;
- advice could encourage unsafe inspection, blocked ventilation or unauthorised fixed work;
- a change would create or use a real account for release testing;
- the release commit, GitHub branch, Sites source, archive and saved version do not reconcile;
- a change would alter the immutable dated audit;
- a legal, regulated-service, privacy, provider or account-ownership decision requires an authorised human.

## Next five logical product steps

1. **Controlled Gmail and Outlook inbox acceptance:** verify the responsive report in dedicated non-customer Gmail and Outlook test inboxes without using a real customer address.
2. **Independent PDF accessibility conformance audit:** test the tagged structure, reading order, links and assistive-technology behavior without claiming PDF/UA until independently verified.
3. **Photo retake, redaction and resumable upload queue:** let customers safely replace, redact and resume guided evidence uploads without weakening private-plan defaults.
4. **Revision labels, notes and selective comparison or export:** make bounded plan history easier to understand and share without broadening restore scope.
5. **Outcome check-ins and before-and-after progress evidence:** help households record completed improvements and observed comfort or usage changes without creating savings promises.
