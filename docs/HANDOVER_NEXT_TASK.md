# Next task handover

Status: active rolling handover
Prepared: 18 July 2026
Implementation baseline: `ab7331b0ae1d6b0ce4a2981278a74a09c95ac708` on `codex/sites-custom-domain-migration` implements the P6-3A price-book batch. Its exact Sites release version is recorded after publication.

## Current delivery summary

The installer Jobs API returns the expected owner-scoped job, and the signed-in list and detail workspace show that job. The remaining client race was corrected in `aa771460b190c7e744caca216bb4c8dde3087c77`: superseded Jobs and Customers index requests are aborted and cannot replace current filter results. A regression assertion protects the cancellation boundary.

P6-2K makes customer trade requests useful for quoting before personal contact is released. The guided request now requires structured property context covering storeys, approximate age and floor area, roof, switchboard and normal access timing. Customers can add property photos, take a new photo through a supported phone or tablet camera, or attach PDF supporting documents.

The privacy boundary is explicit and enforced server side. Every active verified installer allocated to the exact enquiry can view every customer-approved photo and document for quoting guidance while identity, contact details, exact location, private notes and usage data remain withheld. Every installer evidence download is authorised against the current match and recorded. Browser MIME claims are checked against the uploaded file signature. Supported phone photos are converted to bounded JPEGs in the browser, and the server strips JPEG, PNG or WebP metadata before storage. Installer downloads use neutral filenames.

Customers must acknowledge the photo-sharing notice before submission. The consent receipt records notice version `2026-07-18-quoting-photos`. Customers can remove future evidence access, with clear notice that this cannot erase information an installer already viewed or saved.

After a shortlisted installer receives a deliberate contact release, the customer can accept that installer for site assessment and scheduling preparation. Acceptance closes other matches and releases and permits only that installer to create a CRM job from the platform lead.

Arrival windows are installer owned. Only the accepted installer can propose one to three non-overlapping future windows, each between 30 minutes and four hours and within 180 days. Future-time validation uses the property state's Australian timezone. The customer can select one current revision or choose a fourth direct-contact option. Direct contact reveals only the installer business name, contact number, email and ABN, snapshots the disclosure and creates an admin-visible audit notification.

P6-2L materialises a customer-selected arrival window as an unassigned CRM appointment only when the exact accepted installer converts the matched lead to a CRM job. Dispatch assignment continues through the existing owner-scoped staff, availability, working-hours, overlap and revision checks. The verified customer can then acknowledge a bounded site-preparation checklist without seeing internal staff or job records.

Migration `0058_trade_contact_arrival_handoff.sql` adds mandatory trade ABN storage, direct-contact disclosure snapshots, CRM job and appointment links and customer preparation acknowledgement state. New and updated trade profiles require a valid ABN, business name, business contact number and account email.

The upgraded AEA Twilio account remains configured, but the `TLink` Australian sender registration still needs the genuine brand evidence that becomes available on Monday. SMS remains disabled until Twilio approves and provisions the sender.

P6-2M adds one revision-bound operational notification event for each customer-arrival appointment creation, first staff assignment, authorised appointment change and customer preparation confirmation. Customer email requires active optional project updates, an active customer-account consent receipt and no channel opt-out. Installer email requires an active consenting trade account with operational email enabled. Customer SMS additionally requires a verified mobile, current channel consent, active provider callbacks and the explicit `TLINK_SMS_SENDER_APPROVED` release flag, which remains false by default.

Each event creates idempotent audience and channel delivery records without storing recipient contact details in the admin payload. Provider sends are atomically claimed, daily-limit checked and capped at three attempts. Authenticated Resend and Twilio callbacks update both service-reminder and appointment delivery ledgers. The existing administrator delivery workspace now shows privacy-safe appointment delivery health and bounded retry controls.

P6-2N completes the direct-customer photo request loop. An authorised installer office user can open a direct job, start from service-specific photo guidance, edit the exact requirements, issue or replace a 30-day secure link and revoke it when no longer needed. Only the link secret leaves the server; the database stores its hash.

The customer link exposes no name, address or contact details. It guides phone capture through clarity, relevance and private-information checks before every upload. Accepted JPEG, PNG and WebP files keep the existing signature checks, metadata stripping, size limits and private R2 storage, and appear in the exact job's field proof with the requirement, request revision, checklist version and acknowledgement time. The customer can remove a mistaken upload while the request remains active.

## Completed milestones

P6-2O adds an owner-scoped photo-template library with draft, published and archived states. Owners, managers and coordinators can create, duplicate, revise and publish requirements with useful and avoid examples. Published versions are insert-only, archived templates cannot seed new requests, and the safe service defaults remain available.

P6-2P adds deliberate direct-customer photo-request delivery. The job workspace previews a masked email or verified mobile before sending, requires an explicit current-request confirmation and keeps manual copy and share available. A manual CRM customer can receive an operational email after the office user confirms the customer asked for it. SMS additionally requires the matching active customer account, current project-update consent, verified primary mobile, active provider callbacks and the approved Australian sender flag.

Current link secrets are encrypted at rest with the existing protected credential key while their hashes remain the capability verifier. Each replacement increments a token issue and invalidates unfinished deliveries for older issues. Initial sends, two resends and one final-seven-day expiry reminder are independently idempotent by request revision, token issue, intent and channel. Failed sends are atomically claimed and capped at three attempts.

Authenticated Resend and Twilio callbacks now update the photo-request delivery ledger and propagate customer opt-outs. The administrator delivery workspace exposes only channel, intent, status, provider result, attempt count and timestamps. It contains no customer contact, secure link, capability token or image data. Existing links issued before this migration remain valid for manual sharing but must be replaced once before protected provider delivery because their plaintext secret was deliberately never retained.

Live-trade wording validation remains deferred until trades are onboarded, as authorised on 18 July 2026. This does not block implementation or signed-in responsive release inspection.

P6-2Q closes the direct-customer photo-proof review loop. Customers can explicitly finish a complete current request, while owners, managers and coordinators can accept, waive or request a bounded retake for each requirement. Completion and review revisions are append-only, reviewed originals cannot be removed, and a retake reopens only the affected requirement through the current secure link.

Retake guidance uses fixed reason codes and one revision-bound targeted follow-up through the existing consent-aware delivery controls. Field work receives read-only proof readiness, and photo-template reporting receives only aggregate review outcomes. No customer contact, capability token, image analysis or image-derived content is added to those payloads.

P6-3A establishes the authoritative owner-scoped price book. Owners, managers and coordinators receive a top-level workspace with quick-start labour, material and call-out presets; the default form requires only a name, type and sell price while cost, duration, capability and supplier detail remain optional. Active items support search, edit and archive without exposing internal commercial data to customer-facing quote payloads.

Migration `0064_trade_price_book.sql` stores integer-cent supplier cost and sell price, deterministic basis-point markup and margin, immutable price-change revisions and optional references to existing business capabilities and approved supplier catalogue products. Direct-job quote drafts can select an active item and the server snapshots its current authoritative commercial fields into the immutable quote version. Existing issued versions remain unchanged.

## Next milestone contract

### P6-3B batch: reusable job-packet foundation

Outcome: an office user can turn a common service into a ready-to-quote scope in under one minute, without re-entering price-book items, tasks, forms, duration or skill requirements.

### Five linked foundation items

1. Add owner-scoped reusable job packets with a plain-language name, service type and draft, active or archived state.
2. Compose each packet from active price-book items with default quantities and a live cost, sell, markup and margin summary.
3. Reference the existing CRM job-template tasks and form templates instead of creating competing checklist or form records.
4. Calculate estimated duration and required capabilities from the selected items, then show a simple suggested-crew readiness summary from the existing team source.
5. Apply one active packet to a direct-job quote draft in one choice, with duplicate prevention, access tests and desktop plus 390 px responsive coverage.

### In scope

- Existing active price-book items, job-template tasks, form templates, team capabilities and versioned direct-job quote boundaries.
- Office packet management for verified trade roles already authorised to manage business data.
- Additive packet and packet-line schema with deterministic quantity and estimate calculations.
- A fast first-run path with common-service examples and optional detail progressively disclosed.

### Explicitly out of scope

- Customer-facing quote packages, acceptance, signatures, deposits, PDFs or delivery messaging.
- Creating a new task, checklist, form, catalogue, capability or team source of truth.
- Inventory reservations, purchasing, invoicing, accounting sync, asset service reminders or field material consumption.
- Automated scheduling or assigning staff; the packet may only report readiness from existing team data.

### Acceptance criteria

- A standard packet can be created or selected and applied to a direct-job quote draft in under one minute without copying line details.
- Packet estimates use the authoritative current price-book items and clearly identify archived or unavailable dependencies before application.
- Tasks, forms, capabilities and team members remain referenced from their existing owner-scoped records.
- Applying a packet is idempotent for one quote draft and never changes an issued quote revision.
- Only authorised owner-scoped office users can mutate packets; customer and field payloads do not expose internal cost or margin.
- Desktop and 390 px packet-library and apply views have no document-level horizontal overflow.
- `npm run validate` passes on the exact release commit.

### Stop and escalate if

- Existing job templates or forms cannot be referenced without duplicating their source of truth.
- Applying a packet would require rewriting an issued quote revision or bypassing owner scope.
- The slice expands into customer acceptance, deposits, purchasing, inventory, accounting, scheduling or staff assignment.
